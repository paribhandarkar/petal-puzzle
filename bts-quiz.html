        <h3>About the Project:</h3>
        <p>The “Petal Puzzle” was brought to life by the collaborative efforts of Aarti, Pari, Pragya & Tanishqua. It
            was a fun project which was created in a span of 48 hours. Each team member added quite something to the
            group.
        </p>
        <p>The theme that we went for was the Light Academia aesthetic. Classic Literature, Butterfly Wings, Crumpled
            Paper, Pressed Flowers, Beige Tones, Newspaper Cuttings, Botanical Gardens and Forgotten Letters was what we
            had in mind while we pictured our moodboard.</p>

            <p><span>"Meet Aarti"</span> <br> <br> Aarti was in charge of all the micro-interactions. From what animation effect would be applied to submit buttons to how the radio buttons would glow when pressed. <br> <br> With her extreme attention to details we were able to implement high quality interface applications and greatly improved the overall accessibility of the site.</p>

            <h4>Pari</h4>
            <p><span>Pari says "Hii"</span> <br> <br>Pari took care of the entire layout of the website. She created mood boards in order to define the aesthetic and theme of the website and then designed the website from scratch on Figma and implemented it by pure HTML-CSS coding. <br> <br> The animations on the “BTS” page were also done by her.She was also responsible for content-writing.</p>

            <p><span>“Tanishqa is here”</span><br><br>Tanishqa took care of the radio button color change code. It was also because of her that we were able to display the result in the next page, in addition to editing with already implemented JS. <br> <br> Thanks to her amazing JS knowledge.</p>
